Create Views and Cursors

--- VIEWS

1. Create a view named vw_ActiveProjects that lists all projects that are currently active (i.e., EndDate is NULL).
2. Create a view named vw_HighPriorityTasks that lists all tasks with Priority set to 'High'.

--- CURSOR

1. Create a cursor that iterates over all active projects and prints the project names.
2. Create a cursor that iterates over all tasks, and if the current date is past the DueDate, update the Status to 'Overdue'.
